	//for example the string is "rahul likes to code";

	//if you want to read whole line with white spaces then u can use 
	scanf("%[^\n]%*c", arr);	/*It will stop reading if new line is detected but can read white spaces*/
	/*
	^\n stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. 
	Then, with this %*c, it reads the newline character and here,
	 the used * indicates that this newline character is discarded.
